	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. Understanding time complexity helps in writing efficient code that performs well even on large datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm that stores each input element once would have a space complexity of O(n).</p>
